Nonlinear Porous Medium Equation representing "Gas transport in a porous medium". Content: Numerical methods for PDEs (Voronoi FVM) and their implementation using Julia Programming language, space and time discretization using ExtendableGrids.jl, Rothe method, Implicit Euler method, simulation results 1D and 2D cases, improve the performance using DifferentialEquations.jl.

# Installation

To run the code, one should install the package, using one of the following commands:

1\. From the Julian prompt:

```jldoctest
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("Pluto")
```

2\. From the Pkg mode 

```jldoctest
julia> ]
(@v1.6) pkg> add Pluto
```
